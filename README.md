This is an old MERN e-commerce project I built while learning the basics of full-stack development. It includes simple features like product listings, user authentication, cart management, and basic API handling. Even though it’s not a polished app, it helped me understand how MongoDB, Express, React, and Node work together and gave me a solid foundation in building end-to-end JavaScript applications.
